The purpose of this assignment is to experiment with setTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval. I use these, along with dynamically generated elements, to create a short trivia game with a theme of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

This app is also mobile responsive and works on phone and tablet screens.
