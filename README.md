# TriviaGame
A game of wills and wits.

A basic trivia game to work out those  javascript, html, and CSS muscles with a focus on timers.

The purpose of this assignment is to experiment with setTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval. I use these, along with dynamically generated elements, to create a short trivia game with a theme of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

At this point I've also started using bootstrap in almost every assignment and collecting asset resources such as subtlepatterns.com which help me easily put together attractive sites.
